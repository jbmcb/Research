This is a small and very unfinished prototype for a video game.

It will play like a hybrid between Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy,
featuring top-down fighting mechanics and real-time spells & abilities.

It is made using only C++ and Direct2D. No graphics engines or extra
software of any kind. 

It is and always will be free and open source. Consider it a gift.
